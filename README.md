# Creddit
Clojure wrapper for Reddit API  

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/ThatGuyHughesy/creddit.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/ThatGuyHughesy/creddit)
[![Clojars Project](https://img.shields.io/clojars/v/creddit.svg)](https://clojars.org/creddit)

## Installation

Declare creddit in your project.clj:

[![Clojars Project](http://clojars.org/creddit/latest-version.svg)](http://clojars.org/creddit)

Use creddit in your clojure code:

```clojure
(require '[creddit.core :as creddit])
```


## Usage

You will need your Reddit application credentials found here https://www.reddit.com/prefs/apps/

I would recommend using a library such as [cprop](https://github.com/tolitius/cprop) or [environ](https://github.com/weavejester/environ/) to load them in

Your credentials should like this:  

```edn
{:user-client <USER_CLIENT>,
 :user-secret <USER_SECRET>,
 :username <REDDIT_USERNAME>,
 :password <REDDIT_PASSWORD>}
```

The username and password are needed for some actions like submitting but are optional for anonymous actions.

Once you have your credentials loaded in you can initialise the client:

```clojure
(def creddit-client (creddit/init credentials))
```
